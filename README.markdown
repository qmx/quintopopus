# coffee-scented leapmotion robotic finger

_yeah, I spilled coffee on the box shortly after it was laser-cut :(_

This was our family's [RobotsConf](robotsconf.com) project. It was a blast!

The original idea was to build a __quintopod__, but we decided it was too ambitious and shot for doing just a "leg" out of 5. You can watch it working [here](http://instagram.com/p/honsWEho6B/#).

Sources are here, no __jshint__'d, formatting is awful, but I don't care for now.
